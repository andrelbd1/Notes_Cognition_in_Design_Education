### New Directions in Design Cognition: Studies of Representation and Recall
- The purpose of this paper is to pose some new questions for design cognition and outline some paths for studying them.

#### A Review of Design as ill-defined Problem solving
- Design was initially studied as a type of problem solving, as a search of a space of possible solutions for the best or a "satisficing" solution.
- The terms "ill-structured" and "ill-defined" were introduced  to signify that design tasks required definition of the problem space and also the criteria applied to candidate solutions.

#### Protocol Analysis
- The primary empirical method for studying design introduced at the beginning of cognitive psychology was protocol analysis.
- Protocol analysis involves giving small but realistic design tasks to subjects and monitoring their behavior.
- Design thinking is induced from the behavior captured from the protocol, including verbalizations, drawing and gestures.

#### Critique
- Protocol Analysis relies on the information provided in external representations (e.g., verbally and in drawings and notes).
- There has been criticism of the distortations introduced when verbalization is forced.
- Protocol Analysis does not address well the differences between internal and external representations.
- Many groups have also criticized the ill-defined problem solving design paradigm. There are arguments that it is ill-suited for studying  design, noting that designers are part of the situation as well as the actions taken within it.

#### Mental Imagery and the Structure of Knowledge
- The mental representation of knowledge has been an issue of serious study.
