### Studying Engineering Design Learning: Four Verbal Protocol Studies
- The goal is to characterize what learners in engineering schools know about desgin.
- It was conducted four studies of engineering student design behavior using verbal protocol analysis research methodology.

#### Verbal Protocol Analysis: A Method for Studying Engineering Student Design Activity
- It is used to document and understand  the processes associated with congnitive activities.
- In a verbal protocol study, subjects complete experimental tasks while concurrently talking out loud.
- The implementation of verbal protocol analysis can be time-consuming and the results challenging to interpret.
- The process consist of the following general activities (not necessarily in this order):
  - Develop a coding scheme
  - Choose a problem
  - Collect protocol from students as they solve the problem
  - Code the protocols according to the coding scheme
  - Analyze and interpret results

- Develop Coding Scheme to link the verbal protocols and the hypotheses being tested.
