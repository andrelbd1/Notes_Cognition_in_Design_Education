### Studying Engineering Design Learning: Four Verbal Protocol Studies
- The goal is to characterize what learners in engineering schools know about desgin.
- It was conducted four studies of engineering student design behavior using verbal protocol analysis research methodology.

#### Verbal Protocol Analysis: A Method for Studying Engineering Student Design Activity
- It is used to document and understand  the processes associated with congnitive activities.
- In a verbal protocol study, subjects complete experimental tasks while concurrently talking out loud.
- The implementation of verbal protocol analysis can be time-consuming and the results challenging to interpret.
- The process consist of the following general activities (not necessarily in this order):
  - Develop a coding scheme
  - Choose a problem
  - Collect protocol from students as they solve the problem
  - Code the protocols according to the coding scheme
  - Analyze and interpret results

- Develop Coding Scheme to link the verbal protocols and the hypotheses being tested.    
  | **Design Activity** | **Description** |
  | ------------------- | --------------- |
  | Identification of Need | Identify basic needs (purpose, reason for design) |
  | Problem Definition | Define what the problem really is, identify constraints and criteria, reread or question the problem statement |
  | Gathering Definition | Search for and recall information beyond that provided |
  | Generating Ideas | Develop possible solution ideas, list different alternatives |
  | Modeling | Describe how to build the idea, how to make it, measuremntes, dimensions, calculations |
  | Feasibility Analysis | Determine workability, verification of workability, does it meet constraints, criteria, does it make sense | 
  | Evaluation | Compare alternatives (is one better, cheaper) make judgments about one alternative relative to another |
  | Decision | Select one idea or solution among alternatives |
  | Communication | Define the design solution to others, labeling the final design, or writing down instructions |
  | Implementation | Produce or construct a physical device, product, or system |
