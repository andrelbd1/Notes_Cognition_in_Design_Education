### Scenario-based design: A brief history and rationale
- Scenario-based design offers significant and unique leverage on some of the most characteristic and vexing challenges of design work.
-  Scenarios provided five distinct advantages to strategic planners (p. 143-144). 
  - (1) Scenarios help analysts avoid the tempting assumption that circumstances will remain largely the same. They dramatically and persuasively emphasize the wide range of possibilities that must be considered. 
  - (2) Scenarios force analysts to address contextual details and temporal dynamics in problems, which they can avoid if they focus only on abstract descriptions. 
  - (3) By concretely illustrating a complex space of possibilities, and imposing a simple linear rubric of time, scenarios help analysts deal with several aspects of a problem situation simultaneously. They facilitate the comprehension and integration of many interacting elements m psychological, social, political, and military. 
  - (4) Scenarios stimulate the imagination, helping analysts to consider contingencies they might otherwise overlook. They vividly illustrate principles or issues that might be overlooked if one only considered actual events. 
  - (5) Scenarios can be used to consider alternative outcomes to past and present crises.
