### Novice conceptions of design: Implications for the design of learning environments
- Cognitive science research has shown that a learner's prior Knowledge is critical to the development of an integrated and generative knowledge. It seems a certainty that prior knowledge is an essential variable in design learning. Unfortunatelu, however, prior knowledge is often incorrect.
- A theory, as cognitive scientists conceive it, as a represetational system.
  - "Propositional" representation: syntactic strings of sybolic elements. (e.g. Constraint setting is a part of design)
  - "Mental models": structural analogs of real-world or imagined situations. (e.g. A designer is setting constraints)
  - Images: a mental model from a particular perspective. (e.g. The architect is constraining the problem)

- Misconceptions can impede effective learning. Most agree that for learning to occur, at least replacement, often restructuring, and possibly even demolition of the knowledge base, has to occur.
- There are three types of misconceptions:
  - Incorrect: it is relatively easy to change because it is fragment or random collections of false ideas. Removed through refutation/cotradiction.
  - Inconsistent: resist to change because it is a part of a larger mental model that has structure. Removed through confrontation between mental model.
  - Incompatible: it is highly resistant to change. Removed through paradigm shift.
